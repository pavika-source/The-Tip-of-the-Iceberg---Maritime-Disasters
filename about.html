        <p class="txt-1 odd-box"> The RMS Titanic is just the tip of the iceberg... Reading the title, most of you probably recalled the name Titanic, the fictional characters Jack and Rose, and an iceberg. Although hypothermia and drowning is indeed a painful experience, the sinking of the RMS Titanic should not be mistaken for the worst to happen out in the sea. 
        It is pretty disrespectful and ignorant to all the other maritime disasters who had to risk more lives and endure more pain only to be buried under another ship for sake of a love story that is one in a million and made up, keeping in mind that the 1997 film ‘Titanic ‘by James Cameron is and will always remain in my heart. </p>
