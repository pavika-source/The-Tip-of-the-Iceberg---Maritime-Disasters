    <p class="txt-div odd-box"> Charles Joughin, who had carefully secured his lifejacket before entering the sea, outsmarted the North Atlantic's sharpest and coldest weapon. 
    Stephen Cheung, a hypothermia expert from Brock University, commented that although alcohol isn’t your usual hack for survival, it suprisingly gave Joughin a bigger brain. It may have reduced any sensations of lower tempuratures to be absorbed through his skin, reducing his anxiety levels. 
    Unintentionally, Joughin met several key principles for surviving a maritime disaster. First, he avoided the freezing waters as long as possible—he was one of the very last people to get wet that night. Second, and most critically, he maintained his head above the water and succesfully got out.   </p>
    <p class="txt-div odd-box"> Joughin floated in the darkness for close to two hours. As the sun began to rise, he spotted a defeated lifeboat. He swam to it and pulled himself aboard. </p>

      The family could not take advantage of the stairs nearby because the ship was flipping faster than they could climb. 
      Luckily, they reached the top of the stairs and sat on the railings beside the Evans family until the ship had completely turned over to its side and disappeared under the water.  </p>
      <p class="txt-div odd-box"> Grace got submerged under the water twice before she secured her grip to a piece of wreckage floating about. She could not distinguish her parents among the crowd and the constant screaming and splashing. 
      Grace, catching the attention of a few lifeboats nearby, was rescued by a crowded lifeboat and fell unconscious. She regained her senses on the Storstad, where she found herself in bed without her parents, Edward James and Edith Emily. </p>

Their sense of direction had been lost because all the floors, hallways, and rooms they once knew were suddenly flipped horizontally. Survivor Morton Boje caught a girl pinned against a locker with her face looking towards him. 
      What survivor and mechanic Margus Treu thought would be his inevitable death in the engine room, escaped through the chimney that had led him straight into the freezing, turbulent waters of the Baltic Sea.  </p>

      <p class="txt-div odd-box"> Rose Petrus (formerly Rezas) is originally from Schwarzort—now known as Juodkrantė, Lithuania—a small village of about 400 people. At the time, she was working in Gotenhafen (modern-day Gdynia). As the Russian forces advanced rapidly, there was no escape except across the freezing waters of the Baltic Sea. </p>
      <p class="txt-div odd-box">Eventually, Petrus fell unconscious. When she opened her eyes once again, she found herself in what looked like a man’s naval uniform. Her legs were swollen; knees and hands felt inflated like a water balloon, and the discomfort of not being able to stretch her feet could not be put into words—they were stiff and frozen from being stranded in the icy water for so long. 
      She greatly missed the feeling of being warm, and in that moment, she believed she had taken all those moments for granted until someone brought in whiskey to consume till their satisfaction. It was four o’clock in the morning. The ship that rescued us, a German destroyer, was already packed with refugees.</p>

The first group consisted of the loyal followers of the captain of the sinking ship, making every effort to contribute to the rescue of the passengers by following the captain's orders. 
      The second group was mostly made of females including the Collins and Brown family.  The third group consisted of those who lost their heads to fear, breaking into the liquor cabinet and while under the influence, grabbed the other's lifejackets, attempted to rape the women, and looted. There were only a few gentlemen on board to defend the women. </p>
